# LaHire Weather PWA

This project is an extension of my final project for CEIS110, exploring the process of transforming a working Python application into a Progressive Web App (PWA) for easy mobile access.

## Project Overview

In this project, I'm venturing beyond following tutorials to create a PWA from scratch. While I've worked on similar projects in the past, this is my first attempt at building one independently. I've relied on resources like Stack Overflow and GeeksforGeeks for code structure guidance, as my experience with JS/HTML/JSON/CSS outside of guided tutorials is limited.

This README will document my progress, including the challenges faced and solutions found.

## Getting Started

This whole project came about while I was attending the live class for my CEIS110 course. The final project was discussed and during the course of the class I was able to create and complete the final project before the class ended. This isn't because it is a simple project it is because I have done many of the things involved in the project on some of my personal projects and was able to use that experience. Once that was done I decided I wanted it on my phone and remembered doing a PWA project previously and well...now you are reading this.

### Initial Setup

1. Created a basic file structure with separate frontend and backend directories.
2. Included a Procfile for Heroku deployment.
3. Set up placeholder files in the following structure:

```
/backend
  app.py
  Procfile
  requirements.txt
/frontend
  /css
    style.css
  /js
    app.js
  index.html
  manifest.json
  sw.js
README.md
```

### Development Process

1. Used Google to find templates for frontend files (index.html, manifest.json, sw.js).
2. Integrated existing Python functions into app.py for backend functionality.
3. Researched common Python libraries for PWA backends on Heroku through Stack Overflow.
4. Discovered Flask as a popular choice, aligning with my previous experience.
5. Found a helpful freeCodeCamp video tutorial on Flask PWA projects with Heroku hosting: [Flask Course - Python Web Application Development](https://youtu.be/Z1RJmh_OqeA?si=dsNZxf5VmjPw_G4g)
